                I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
                I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
                'Cause I love you, yeah
                It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
                But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
                Let me tell the truth
                Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

                You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
                You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
                You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
                I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
                I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
                I try to find a reason to pull us apart
                It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
                And I know that you're worth it

                Just know that I would die for you
                Baby, I would die for you, yeah
                The distance and the time between us
                It'll never change my mind 'cause
